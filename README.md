# HotSnack---Pandas-Skill-Showcase
Hello! Welcome to my sample analysis for a last mile logistics HotSnack delivery platform based in LA. <br>

**Dataset assumptions:**
- Contains ~1 month of data
- Date information is currently in UTC; the platform operates in PST 
- The dataset needs to be analyzed quickly and the C-suite is looking for data-driven reccomendations where clarity on the dataset cannot be investigated (i.e. updating null values)
- The delivery platform launched in 2022

The following analysis will look to showcase the following skillset:
- 🎯 **Structuring Problems:** Demonstrate how I structure my thoughts and approach problems 
- 📊 **Data Analytics Knowledge:** Ability to utilize 🐍 python and 🐼 pandas to clean and analyze data
- 🔥 **Providing Data-driven Insights:** Ability to dive into the root cause and provide actionable recommendations
